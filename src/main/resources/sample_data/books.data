She sets out to become a scientist and polar explorer, despite those who believe that a young woman has no place in this harsh world, and in 1892, her determination leads her back to northern Greenland at the head of a British expedition.<br><br>Yearning for wider horizons, American geologist Jakob de Beyn joins a rival expedition led by the furiously driven Lester Armitage. When the path of Flora's expedition crosses theirs, the three lives become intertwined. All are obsessed with the north, a place of violent extremes: perpetual night and endless day; frozen seas and coastal meadows; heroism and selfishness. Armitage's ruthless desire to be the undisputed leader of polar discovery sets in motion a chain of events whose tragic outcomes--both for his team of scientists and the indigenous people of Greenland--will reverberate for years to come.<br><br>Set against the stark, timeless beauty of northern Greenland and fin-de-siecle New York and London, <i>Under a Pole Star </i>is a compelling look at the dark side of the golden age of exploration, a study of the corrosive power of ambition, and an epic, incendiary love story.

She ends up in Sweden, which has transformed into a nuclear nation, and the fate of the world now lies in Nombeko's hands.</p>", "imageLinks" : { "smallThumbnail" : "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9N9zAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&imgtk=AFLRE71Z_BtK9DdEqeByp9udEQjdGiyE6rrhRMJC6_p55nCaWzDWpQWAAss1IFe5THeFyvFw4vcxelvLRqTAUsSTsGn4qprZF1MUhkXIXVgsOubb6LESZOC0T8FlrC4qHtUHSURyKrcV&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail" : "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9N9zAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE72FCORT5NfYyZINUAx_S-LaWeuHTGkGt95dEa64zUrOkGcFp46lZFXtKez2FLUv6finfI41N4REK0PyLdqTbiK5OWVuoiqB4SrollbQwz-5YVLAFU7y0TMWjqoXAAVAgbd3FIWF&source=gbs_api" }, "previewLink" : "http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9N9zAgAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api" }, "accessInfo" : { "viewability" : "NO_PAGES", "embeddable" : false, "publicDomain" : false } }, "createdBy" : { "authenticationServiceId" : "107641352409228521888", "firstName" : "Aidan", "lastName" : "Whiteley", "fullName" : "Fred Bloggs", "email" : "fred.bloggs@example.com", "link" : "https://plus.google.com/+AidanWhiteley", "picture" : "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-tV0bZgdRS4Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAsE/K2aQCImjvUI/photo.jpg", "authProvider" : "GOOGLE" }, "comments" : [ { "_id" : "45359a9b-79b3-40f6-a20f-455c9468a0e6", "owner" : { "authenticationServiceId" : "1632142143498857", "firstName" : "Aidan", "lastName" : "Whiteley", "fullName" : "Fred Bloggs", "link" : "https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/1632142143498857/", "picture" : "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p50x50/27540595_1646377895408615_873932859618115488_n.jpg?oh=54666695335266abf092aad85ef9742f&oe=5B136C80", "authProvider" : "FACEBOOK" }, "comment" : "Test from mobb.", "entered" : ISODate("2018-02-18T00:24:35.527Z"), "deleted" : false } ] }

The male protagonist is a travel writer who falls desperately in love with a beautiful East Berlin woman, Petra.

He is devastated at such betrayal, believing that every element of their relationship had been false. <br>It is only years later, once Petra is dead, that the narrator discovers the truth. Petra was being forced to give information to the Stasi, who were holding her son captive under threats of death. Too late he learns that the relationship was a sincere one -- the feelings were real -- and it was only Petra's fear for her son's life that led to her betrayal of her lover.

It consists of five course books (each with an accompanying book of teacher's notes), two companion reference books and a Roman Studies Handbook containing bibliographical references.</p>", "imageLinks" : { "smallThumbnail" : "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WQTvAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&imgtk=AFLRE73XXbtaDaEdmhCRLypKShQ-smU2UMW2KytXuwxc63090KVcwATZ94-dwqfpjW7PRcQhxvh8oEQ9Gpvo1IcFA5SX_Ac__aTh_oqk6ThuBKCkDW1NhBpyCxgxqGiWWm23-kOiDmO9&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail" : "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WQTvAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE72LIgEZ38VWmgH71nqrqxbjVgJEvVsykr8xy3uBe-mFYgfWn-u6MTPr61LEa98uSGxW6Vh-XDjhwH7TvguIJ1grCVoFQJzcu8npH5lQSZ26s90TgBXmlAeTTW857iAyTDpvgu8Z&source=gbs_api" }, "previewLink" : "http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WQTvAAAACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api" }, "accessInfo" : { "viewability" : "NO_PAGES", "embeddable" : false, "publicDomain" : false } }, "createdBy" : { "authenticationServiceId" : "116989648358715714959", "firstName" : "Cloudy", "lastName" : "Bookclub", "fullName" : "Cloudy Bookclub", "email" : "thecloudybookclub@gmail.com", "picture" : "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QAibbIG4v9E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAg/fqJREZdqwok/photo.jpg", "authProvider" : "GOOGLE" } }

Scala embraces the functional programming style without abandoning the object-oriented paradigm, and it allows you to write programs more concisely than in Java. Because Scala runs on the JVM, it can access any Java library and is interoperable with familiar Java frameworks. Scala also makes it easier to leverage the full power of concurrency. </p> <p> <br> </p> <p>Written for experienced Java, C++, or C# programmers who are new to Scala or functional programming, <i> <b>Scala for the Impatient, Second Edition,</b> </i> introduces the key Scala concepts and techniques you need in order to be productive quickly. It is the perfect introduction to the language, particularly for impatient readers who want to learn the fundamentals of Scala so they can start coding quickly. It doesn’t attempt to exhaustively list all the features of the language or make you suffer through long and contrived examples. Instead, carefully crafted examples and hands-on activities guide you through well-defined stages of competency, from basic to expert. </p> <p> <br> </p> <p>This revised edition has been thoroughly updated for Scala 2.12 and reflects current Scala usage. It includes added coverage of recent Scala features, including string interpolation, dynamic invocation, implicit classes, and futures. Scala is a big language, but you can use it effectively without knowing all of its details intimately. This title provides precisely the information that you need to get started in compact, easy-to-understand chunks. </p> <ul> <li>Get started quickly with Scala’s interpreter, syntax, tools, and unique idioms </li> <li>Master core language features: functions, arrays, maps, tuples, packages, imports, exception handling, and more </li> <li>Become familiar with object-oriented programming in Scala: classes, inheritance, and traits </li> <li>Use Scala for real-world programming tasks: working with files, regular expressions, and XML </li> <li>Work with higher-order functions and the powerful Scala collections library </li> <li>Leverage Scala’s powerful pattern matching and case classes </li> <li>Create concurrent programs with Scala futures </li> <li>Implement domain-specific languages </li> <li>Understand the Scala type system </li> <li>Apply advanced “power tools,” such as annotations, implicits, and type classes</li> </ul>", "imageLinks" : { "smallThumbnail" : "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t57LDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71oNxUIbuDwgZ3mehiwUoLN6CjlFrXVjnAae2y1J2V9ofb4Zh6lslnd_47At1d_HZCjJdGfUGix_uuYpRE0HvviI6qrmzEPsqrxR8lI5co-iU_96aD7ya230sU2kg0or4-7sLZa&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail" : "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t57LDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70hAghwDO1S7SjjDDiWmR2_VzX9WeGAHJfMTyCZoQwIft3qfS5oRrwjeoaeik1K1KoDxy4wD0WRkHiMt3ZBkyfEWf0bYvh8kohxtaAdhcJ6cBLjjIHY_ppO5agi8Ge4NtA9UbqY&source=gbs_api", "small" : "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t57LDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE727TaC7RgdkFxtZYmXPgwj05mtWGxtyctFbb4rcIgZeaVP0DByuG45GsVv5Oi8NOw7ljCVFZSiwKlx4JelNtlyFc2UYIR-Vl16hl2y5Xw5zY-x3uog3noDYb2459gvWR2ho2u0N&source=gbs_api", "medium" : "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t57LDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE729bnLnP42eKhCZZ-60FDdQyTCd_eBLuBHVo3k7Ehide7KDwGB9kuaVDpxTJLMGyNiFsnyuKA4-FYc5-jfmmum07OTNK4uAcF-ai4sHNi1fY5_7p5X6-Eoq-zUHOTXrxQmVJnA2&source=gbs_api", "large" : "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t57LDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73TJjLRXbIH7qisSorHFUNBBU0JSHXyT2L2evkP3gS7e2iq8Yk5pDO6grHKLvooWL9yEP_dvESpmYBTjgTcP-C2klTbu03_dCKVZpnIOuOA5qK9qhg5HIIpoohgtGOytj4kD3Ll&source=gbs_api", "extraLarge" : "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t57LDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=6&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71YJp6ms2zL-FYZ-W062nqQGTrk7_jJNH9XBlAqsG96KNSq6P0hgrawg0LWiklUtAqZ1VHi2ROsZ5Quc9qvcrwnEjX6RwwWuLCOqxaTXQTaUt1BnqyFY9Yhvew-XKiOh2enaqxK&source=gbs_api" }, "previewLink" : "http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=t57LDQAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api" }, "accessInfo" : { "viewability" : "PARTIAL", "embeddable" : true, "publicDomain" : false } }, "createdBy" : { "authenticationServiceId" : "116989648358715714959", "firstName" : "Cloudy", "lastName" : "Bookclub", "fullName" : "Cloudy Bookclub", "email" : "thecloudybookclub@gmail.com", "picture" : "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QAibbIG4v9E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAg/fqJREZdqwok/photo.jpg", "authProvider" : "GOOGLE" } }
