She sets out to become a scientist and polar explorer, despite those who believe that a young woman has no place in this harsh world, and in 1892, her determination leads her back to northern Greenland at the head of a British expedition.<br><br>Yearning for wider horizons, American geologist Jakob de Beyn joins a rival expedition led by the furiously driven Lester Armitage. When the path of Flora's expedition crosses theirs, the three lives become intertwined. All are obsessed with the north, a place of violent extremes: perpetual night and endless day; frozen seas and coastal meadows; heroism and selfishness. Armitage's ruthless desire to be the undisputed leader of polar discovery sets in motion a chain of events whose tragic outcomes--both for his team of scientists and the indigenous people of Greenland--will reverberate for years to come.<br><br>Set against the stark, timeless beauty of northern Greenland and fin-de-siecle New York and London, <i>Under a Pole Star </i>is a compelling look at the dark side of the golden age of exploration, a study of the corrosive power of ambition, and an epic, incendiary love story.

Petra was being forced to give information to the Stasi, who were holding her son captive under threats of death. Too late he learns that the relationship was a sincere one -- the feelings were real -- and it was only Petra's fear for her son's life that led to her betrayal of her lover. But the crucial moment, when he had the choice to commit fully to her and find the truth or to walk away, has gone for ever. <br>Like Kennedy's previous highly acclaimed novels, The Moment brilliantly illustrates the irrationality of love and the crucial moments which define whole lives.", "imageLinks" : { "smallThumbnail" : "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oPDyF8U5p-oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE714oTMI2RHZ4UmnF3IaBpbu9r6-GgMjUIP-dJmGirflo5Ybzs6rtfWQgqhoXlsIqBoIU4Tmniqn5RCp9tUkQMefxV7J4kmN3CkOvgZzKUNv8ThAjARMbcxC6tCcYBBjLc6U6J0p&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail" : "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oPDyF8U5p-oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73KjpKwfxy4TyEQ8Mtkc4SVNl9X15tpqKjyL_JOX2kYnXBwPkGXlq-8voUZshv3V8QnERqxDAkXEOFc1p45BFVqdEJSuVpy6Aq5OCRHu-fZQCFvE9L7moYvNQTNzJLNPBtx9hLe&source=gbs_api", "small" : "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oPDyF8U5p-oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70Ne6dvbeWr0Z-SBJMxUQXrLamdxcJ0rS-s-aSRF0rzgcuLAIs0Mgt8Whg-W0ta6NDADSsD5oglRt2GKgasht4mgJxBYb9renmUEZPlJh_vHurDwa2TI51dT8TZd1JphOyE51_P&source=gbs_api", "medium" : "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oPDyF8U5p-oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70005x0Y1k_eDS-uCbuJewyggK7UQzzhyJlMEEClC8tm6Qcuv_EO1hSRakULe6Xn8zHVUOxluIImneNLt38iAdxXl4q8dSWXh4c-j6bWqZ3AgRt6yLnaRiNDVWXMOUGEKNwyqNj&source=gbs_api" }, "previewLink" : "http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oPDyF8U5p-oC&hl=&source=gbs_api" }, "accessInfo" : { "viewability" : "PARTIAL", "embeddable" : true, "publicDomain" : false } }, "createdBy" : { "authenticationServiceId" : "107641352409228521888", "firstName" : "Aidan", "lastName" : "Whiteley", "fullName" : "Aidan Whiteley", "email" : "aidan.whiteley@gmail.com", "link" : "https://plus.google.com/+AidanWhiteley", "picture" : "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-tV0bZgdRS4Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAsE/K2aQCImjvUI/photo.jpg", "authProvider" : "GOOGLE" } }
