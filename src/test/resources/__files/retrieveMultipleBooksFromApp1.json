All the ones I looked up were.",

She does not pretend the past is like the present, or that the people of ancient Greece were just like us. She shows us their strangeness; discerning, sure-footed, challenging our values, piquing our curiosity, she leads us through an alien landscape that moves and delights us.” —Hilary Mantel</b></b><br>In myth, Theseus was the slayer of the child-devouring Minotaur in Crete. What the founder-hero might have been in real life is another question, brilliantly explored in <i>The King Must Die</i>. Drawing on modern scholarship and archaeological findings at Knossos, Mary Renault’s Theseus is an utterly lifelike figure—a king of immense charisma, whose boundless strivings flow from strength <i>and</i> weakness—but also one steered by implacable prophecy.<br><br>The story follows Theseus’s adventures from Troizen to Eleusis, where the death in the book’s title is to take place, and from Athens to Crete, where he learns to jump bulls and is named king of the victims. Richly imbued with the spirit of its time, this is a page-turner as well as a daring act of imagination.<br><br>Renault’s story of Theseus continues with the sequel <i>The Bull from the Sea.<br></i><br>This ebook features an illustrated biography of Mary Renault including rare images of the author.<i><br></i>",

The Civil War is less than one year old. The fighting has begun in earnest, and the nation has begun to realize it is in for a long, bloody struggle. Meanwhile, President Lincoln's beloved eleven-year-old son, Willie, lies upstairs in the White House, gravely ill. In a matter of days, despite predictions of a recovery, Willie dies and is laid to rest in a Georgetown cemetery. \"My poor boy, he was too good for this earth,\" the president says at the time. \"God has called him home.\" Newspapers report that a grief-stricken Lincoln returns, alone, to the crypt several times to hold his boy's body.<br> <br> From that seed of historical truth, George Saunders spins an unforgettable story of familial love and loss that breaks free of its realistic, historical framework into a supernatural realm both hilarious and terrifying. Willie Lincoln finds himself in a strange purgatory where ghosts mingle, gripe, commiserate, quarrel, and enact bizarre acts of penance. Within this transitional state--called, in the Tibetan tradition, the bardo--a monumental struggle erupts over young Willie's soul.<br> <i><br> Lincoln in the Bardo</i> is an astonishing feat of imagination and a bold step forward from one of the most important and influential writers of his generation. Formally daring, generous in spirit, deeply concerned with matters of the heart, it is a testament to fiction's ability to speak honestly and powerfully to the things that really matter to us. Saunders has invented a thrilling new form that deploys a kaleidoscopic, theatrical panorama of voices to ask a timeless, profound question: How do we live and love when we know that everything we love must end?<b><br> <br> \"A luminous feat of generosity and humanism.\"--Colson Whitehead, <i>The</i> <i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br> <br> <b>\"A masterpiece.\"<i>--</i>Zadie Smith</b>",

      "summary": "I know my rating of just \"OK\" is probably a little harsh but this book didn't really click with me.\nIt is a good whodunnit and it starts well with a murder and scene setting in Temple Chambers. However, the ending was a little unsatisfactory for me with too much being summed up using the rather unlikely \"literary device\" of the murder victim making it all clear by .... No - I won't say too much as the book is actually worth reading.\nThe book is also slightly odd in that it is billed as \"an Adam Dalgliesh mystery\" and yet just as much \"paper time\" is spent on his side kick - Kate Miskin (who is probably the more interesting character).\nI'd probably read another P.D. James - but not for a while.",

          "description": "Read P.D. James in Large Print!<br><br>It begins, dramatically enough, with a trial for murder. The distinguished criminal lawyer Venetia Aldridge is defending Garry Ashe on charges of having brutally killed his aunt. For Aldridge the trial is mainly a test of her courtroom skills, one more opportunity to succeed--and she does. But now murder is in the air. The next victim will be Aldridge herself, stabbed to death at her desk in her Chambers in the Middle Temple, a bloodstained wig on her head. Enter Commander Adam Dalgliesh and his team, whose struggle to investigate and understand the shocking events cannot halt the spiral into more horrors, more murders...<br><br><i>A Certain Justice</i> is P.D. James at her strongest.  In her first foray into the strange closed world of the Law Courts and the London legal community, she has created a fascinating tale of interwoven passion and terror. As each character leaps into unforgettable life, as each scene draws us forward into new complexities of plot, she proves yet again that no other writer can match her skill in combining the excitement of the classic detective story with the richness of a fine novel. In its subtle portrayal of morality and human behavior, <i>A Certain Justice</i> will stand alongside <i>Devices and Desires</i> and <i>A Taste for Death</i> as one of P.D. James's most important, accomplished and entertaining works.",
