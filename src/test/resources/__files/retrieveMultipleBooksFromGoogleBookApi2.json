        "description": "Was it fun to do a space walk? How squashed were you in the capsule on the way back? What were your feelings as you looked down on Earth for the first time? Were you ever scared? Where to next -- the Moon, Mars, or beyond? Based on his historic mission to the International Space Station, Ask an Astronaut is Tim Peake's guide to life in space, and his answers to the thousands of questions he has been asked since his return to Earth. With explanations ranging from the mundane -- how do you wash your clothes or go to the bathroom while in orbit? -- to the profound -- what's the point? -- all written in Tim's characteristically warm style, Tim shares his thoughts on every aspect of space exploration. From training for the mission to launch, to his historic spacewalk, to re-entry, he reveals for readers of all ages the cutting-edge science behind his groundbreaking experiments, and the wonders of everyday life on board the International Space Station #askanastronaut, and a selection are answered by Tim in the book, accompanied with illustrations, diagrams, and never-before-seen photos.",

The Right Stuff for a new generation. THE PERFECT GIFT FOR ANY SPACE TRAVEL ENTHUSIAST ____________________________________________________________________ 'This book is brilliant - once in a blue moon. A book for the whole family.' Chris Evans, Virgin Radio 'The most wonderful book ... Tim Peake is a historian and encyclopaedia of space.' Rory Stewart 'An extraordinary book. For anyone - even if you're not interested in Space. If you're interested in human stories and the human character - this is delightful.' BBC Breakfast 'A fascinating, detailed, playful book drawn from extensive research – Peake met seven Apollo astronauts, Russian cosmonauts and various other space technicians – as well as his considerable personal experience. Lifts the lid on what space is like: the dedication and sacrifice; the politics and pantomime; the practicalities and the peril; the glory and fame; the adjustment back to normal life.' iPaper 'A thrilling human history of space' Daily Mirror 'The bible of space travel' Chris Moyles, Radio X ____________________________________________________________________ As seen in the major TV series Secrets of Our Universe with Tim Peake. Only 656 people in human history have left Earth. In Space: The Human Story, astronaut Tim Peake traces the lives of these remarkable men and women who have forged the way, from Yuri Gagarin to Neil Armstrong, from Valentina Tereshkova to Peggy Whitson. Full of exclusive new stories, and astonishing detail only an astronaut would know, the book conveys what space exploration is really like: the wondrous view of Earth, the surreal weightlessness, the extraordinary danger, the surprising humdrum, the unexpected humor, the newfound perspective, the years of training, the psychological pressures, the grueling physical toll, the thrill of launch and the trepidation of re-entry. The book also examines the surprising, shocking and often poignant stories of astronauts back on Earth, whose lives are forever changed as they readjust to terra firma. Publication of the book comes on the eve of NASA's plans to return to the moon, fifty years after an astronaut last walked on the lunar surface. In 2024 the Artemis II mission will send four astronauts to orbit the moon. In 2025 Artemis III will send the first woman and the first person of color to step on the lunar surface. What will separate these upcoming moonwalkers from the legendary Apollo crews? Does it still take a daring-do attitude, super-human fitness, intelligence, plus the 'Right-stuff' - a fabled grace under pressure? And how will astronauts travel even further - to Mars and beyond? Space: The Human Story reveals all.",

        "description": "The inspirational autobiography of Britain's beloved astronaut Tim Peake, the #1 bestselling author of Hello, is this Planet Earth? and Ask an Astronaut As heard on BBC Radio 4 Desert Island Discs __________________ 'What surprised me was how entirely serene I felt. I was weightless, no forces exerting myself on my body. To my left was the Space Station. Below me, gradually going into shadow, was the Earth. And over my right shoulder was the universe.' In fascinating and personal detail, and drawing on exclusive diaries and audio recordings from his mission, astronaut Tim Peake takes readers closer than ever before to experience what life in space is really like: the sights, the smells, the fear, the sacrifice, the exhilaration and the deep and abiding wonder of the view. Warm, inspiring and often funny, Tim also charts his surprising road to becoming an astronaut, from a shy and unassuming boy from Chichester who had a passion for flight, to a young British Army officer, Apache helicopter pilot, flight instructor and test pilot who served around the world. Tim's extensive eighteen-year career in the Army included the command of a platoon of soldiers in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, deployment in Bosnia, and operations in Afghanistan. Full of life lessons for readers of all ages, Limitless is the story of how ordinary can become extraordinary. __________________ 'For someone who has literally been out of this world Tim's an incredibly down to earth guy and I think you'll be amazed at some of the things he has done ... it's so inspiring to know that even going into space didn't change him as much as being a parent did.' JOE WICKS 'Tim is one of our nation's good guys - and his story is a testament to his courage, kindness and a never-give-up spirit.' BEAR GRYLLS 'Full of courage, camaraderie and daring escapades, this reads like a Boys' Own adventure' MIRROR 'A fantastic book' PIERS MORGAN 'Fasten your seatbelt for an exhilarating read ... His accounts of blasting into orbit at 25 times the speed of sound and floating, weightless, around the space station are enthralling.' EXPRESS Bestseller in the UK, Sunday Times, October 2020",
